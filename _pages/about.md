2019.
I am a graduate student of Worcester Polytechnic Institute and now I am pursuing a master degree of Information Technology major. Before this, I have a bachelor degree of business adminstration, minor in German. I earned comprehensive scholarship every year and always pursue a better academic performance.

Lots of people asked me that why you want/transfer to study IT?

My answer is that:
firstly, I worked for a consulting department in 2017, and I found that this job need me to use many analytical softwares and use python to collect the data from Internet source. I need a systematic knowledge of Information technology. So I went to the USA and began pursuing a master degree in Information Technology. I am working hard and gradually familiar or even master in SQL, Python, JavaScript.

Secondly, I found that there is a trend that we need a bridge between IT and business. We saw that many companys have communication problems with cross-functional team. Business department only focus on business operation while IT,R&D department only focus on technical stuff. I want to be a person who can handle this two areas, so I work hard to sharp my IT skills as well.




A tenical person
======
I had academic knowledge of IT and Data analysis. I used to use python and SQL to collect data and figure math problems.  I am also familiar with using SPSS and SAS to analyze the data. I attended some projects which used these programming languages, I will post them in the project module.Through these IT project, I improved my troubleshooting problem and programming skills. 

Beyond the knowledge from the class, I also took online classes for Html5/CSS to sharp my IT skills. I am now have some experience with the framework and process of front-end design. I worked for a company(Mass Medical International Company) in Boston to develop their website, which helps me to learn a lot of front-end design principles and funcitons.


A businessman
======
I have worked for many kinds of companies. I did researcher job, sales assistant, e-commerce manager and strategy intern. I began my own business in 2016. With some friends, I registered our company: "Shanghai QuanLi Culture Communication Co. Ltd", we created this Internet company by financing, our business is focused on sporting events, sports product sales, Internet platform popularization. I really learned a lot of business operation experience and negotiation skills from this company. After one year, we end our business because of financing problem.
After that, I did sales job in Pearson Education group. I selled the book to professors, educational organizations; I managed the logistic system and I tried to maintain the relationship of customers. My supervisor Queen_Zou, during my tenure, once had the best KPI over all sales in East China areas.
Because my advisor, I steped in to vehicle industry. I worked in Volvo in Shanghai for their sharing car business. Then I went to Beijing and worked for Daimler, Strategy department. Daimler is the best employer I have met, I learned how to solve hard business problems and use technical way to excavate business insights.
