title: "Reference letter2_ProfessorHongPing_The Department of Business Administration,East China University of Science and Technology"
excerpt: "As the professor in department of Business Management at East China University of Science and Technology, I have the honor to recommend an excellent student,Shuang for his career or education path.
I believe that I have got close observation and subjective assessment of his academic potentials and motivation through observing his performance in my class, Marketing Engineering. 
His strong interest and talent could be seen from his unique perspectives on computer technology & data analytics topics. 
For example, in the discussion session, he was good at using the computer technologydata analytics to support his ideas. 
Unlike other students, Chen Shuang used mathematical software properly to analyze the collected data and present his analytical results in our class. 
His ideas were always based on facts and theory, not subjective guesswork. 
I think this point is very valuable for a business school student. 
After my classes, he also used his spare time to investigate programming skills and practiced into his study and work.
So, I recommended him to do a teacher assistant for Prof Stannis, who is from HEC business school, for “Data Analysis and Process Decision Making” class.
