May 13, 2019, Lisa managed Shuang directly

Shuang worked for our company as an IT specialist as well as a digital marketing intern. He was tasked with coordinating with our IT outsourcing team to design our websites, finding software solutions, troubleshooting, designing IT solutions for business development and other related duties.

During the course of his employment, Shuang proved himself to be a dependable employee and a hard worker with solid problem solving and technical skills. He is such a kind person that our colleagues all like to ask him for hardware or software solutions. 

Shuang is dedicated, intelligent, responsible and he has never missed a deadline for our organization. let me say I have no hesitation in recommending Shuang for any position pertaining to IT and business development.
